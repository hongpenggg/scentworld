# scentworld
playground to experiment with different scent notes

there are two versions:
- https://hongpenggg.github.io/scentworld/ (MAIN Version)
- https://hongpenggg.github.io/scentworld/gemini.html (Still working on the Gemini API integration to "dream" of scent memory)

Going to add more notes + memories some time in the future :)
