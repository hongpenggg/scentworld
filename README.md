## 🌟 What is ScentWorld?

ScentWorld is an immersive web application that transforms fragrance composition into a visual and narrative experience. By dragging and dropping scent notes into a perfume pyramid, users unlock vivid memory scenes that evolve dynamically with each addition.

Think of it as a digital perfume organ meets storytelling engine — where jasmine, leather, and sea salt don't just blend into a fragrance, but conjure entire worlds.

## 🎨 How It Works

### The Memory Engine

ScentWorld's core innovation is its **Combinatorial Scene Generator**:

1. **Family Analysis** — Counts note families (Floral, Woody, etc.) in your composition
2. **Dominant Detection** — Identifies primary and secondary family influences
3. **Base Scene Selection** — Maps dominant family to an atmospheric setting
4. **Layering Modifiers** — Adds secondary family characteristics
5. **Note-Specific Details** — Inserts unique flavor text for special ingredients (e.g., oud, ink, marine)
6. **Hybrid Titles** — Creates special names for specific family combinations

**Example:**
- **Top:** Bergamot, Lemon → *Citrus*
- **Heart:** Rose, Jasmine → *Floral*  
- **Base:** Sandalwood, Oud → *Woody*

→ **Generated Scene:** *"The Enchanted Library"* — A mahogany study where bright sunlight streams through stained glass, the air thick with blooming jasmine climbing ancient bookshelves...
